# Spacex-microsite

---

## Brief

1. Create a microsite for SpaceX/NASA to raise awareness about space program activity around the world.
2. The site should appeal to a specific target audience and provide links to more information, live feeds of launches, and so forth.
3. The site should include a minimum of (4) pages, be responsive, and function well on a variety of platforms.
4. Use JavaScript to connect to an API for dynamic data and construction and styling of HTML/CSS. While a calendar is not mandatory, some kind of schedule or timeline information is recommended.
5. An HTML5 contact form with JavaScript validation is required.
6. The site should be well-designed and easy to use, and conform to WCAG standards.
7. A Git repository should be set up specifically for this project. Include the link to your repo in your report.
8. Do not use Bootstrap or similar frameworks. We want to see your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills.
9. HTML should be neat and semantic.
10. CSS should follow the DRY principle and be succinct with good class names. All CSS should be written in external stylesheets and not in the HTML.
11. JavaScript should all be in external .JS file(s) and be well written. An API call must be included as well as demonstration of DOM manipulation.
